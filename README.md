My name is Maria Ioanna Spyrakou and I have been working on modular decomposition of cographs and digraphs for SageMath in Google summer of code 2017. 

As part of the project, I implemented in python code for:
<ul> 
  <li> modular decomposition of cographs, according to [1],[2],  </li>
  <li> a cograph generator, according to [3], and </li>
  <li>modular decomposition of digraphs according to [4],[5]. </li>
</ul>

## About Modular Decomposition
Modular decomposition of a graph is a decomposition into subsets of vertices, called modules, such that every vertex of the module has uniform relationship with every other vertex outside the module. Modular decomposition of a graph can be represented as a rooted tree, where the leaves correspond to vertices and the internal nodes (more precisely: the subgraph defined by the children of each internal node) correspond to the strong modules (i.e. the modules that do not overlap any other module). The importance of modular decomposition is that it represents all possible ways to decompose a graph into quotients and factors and some of its applications include: transitive orientation, weighted maximum clique, coloring, graph drawing and in many combinatorial optimization problems. 

In this project we introduce the first open-source implementation of modular decomposition of co-graphs as well as the first open-source Python implementation of modular decomposition of digraphs.

## Modular Decomposition of Cographs:

Cographs (or totally decomposable graphs) are defined as the class of graphs formed from a single vertex under the closure of the operations of union and complement [1]. Equivalently cographs are the P4-free graphs, that is the graphs that have no induced path on 4 vertices. 
Every cograph has unique modular decomposition and  is defined by the properties of its modular decomposition. As a result, each internal node of the cotree (i.e. modular decomposition tree of a cograph) corresponds either to union or join of subgraphs defined by the children of that node. Those nodes will be called series (node label: '1') or parallel (node label '0') respectively. 

<br>

### Python implementation:

Given a graph in sage structure or an adjacency list of the graph, returns the modular decomposition tree (cotree), if the input graph is cograph. 

#### Functions included:
<ul>
    <li> Cograph_recognition: Contains 3 functions that test if the input graph is a cograph, by searching if there is a P4 path on any induced subgraph on 4 vertices.  </li>
    <li> Cograph_modular_decomposition: if the input graph is a cograph, then construct its cotree by adding incrementally one by one its nodes. When all nodes are added the modular decomposition tree is returned. </li>
</ul>

For the correctness of the code, the code was tested on all cographs with n=3,....,16 nodes as follows.

<br>

### Cograph generator:
Given the number of nodes n, generates all cotrees that correspond to all cographs with n nodes. 
<ul>
The example includes the testing of the modular decomposition code: 
<li>Generate all cotrees with n=3,..,16 nodes, using the cograph_generator.</li>
<li>Find their corresponding cographs.</li>
<li>Run the modular decomposition code for each cograph and test if the output matches the initial cotree. </li>
</ul>

Given a digraph in sage structure, returns the modular decomposition tree.

      -- Input options:
      
            1) A sage graph / python dictionary with nodes and ALL their neighbors
            2) A list with the nodes and a nested list with their "eliminated neighbors", meaning that a node can have as 
               neighbors only the nodes that are adjacent and precede in the given order (see example)

            check if in any subgraph of 4 vertices there is a path. If so, the graph is not a co-graph, otherwise it is a cograph.
